Solutions to Advent of Code 2025 tasks in the Rust language.

Solutions return answers to two parts of the task at once.

---

The purpose of these solutions was to write algorithms that solve 2 parts of the task at once (at the same time, if possible), without using third-party crates and with as few formatted lines of code as possible, with a balance for optimization.
Of course, you can increase the code of each algorithm by 2-3 times and get the most optimized code in both time and memory. But that wasn't my main goal.
